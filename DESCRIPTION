Description: High-level tools for working with data.world data sets. data.world is a community 
    where you can find interesting data, store and showcase your own data and data projects, 
    and find and collaborate with other members. In addition to exploring, querying and 
    charting data on the data.world site, you can access data via 'API' endpoints and 
    integrations. Use this package to access, query and explore data sets, and to 
    integrate data into R projects. Visit <https://data.world>, for additional information.
